# iRoPro - interactive Robot Programming tool
[![Build Status](http://build.ros.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Ibin_uT64__rapid_pbd__ubuntu_trusty_amd64__binary)](http://build.ros.org/job/Ibin_uT64__rapid_pbd__ubuntu_trusty_amd64__binary/)

iRoPro is an interactive Robot Programming tool, currently developed for the Baxter robot.
The goal of the system is to provide an easy way to program low- and high-level manipulation actions that can be used with a task planner to complete more complex tasks.
It is based on [Rapid PbD](https://github.com/jstnhuang/rapid_pbd/) which is a programming by demonstration (PbD) system for the PR2, Fetch, and Baxter robots.

## Program model
Users use the iRoPro interface to create *actions* and *problems*.
A video of the working system can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/NgaTPG8dZwg)
